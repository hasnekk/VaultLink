# VaultLink
A LOCAL password menager.

An Electron desktop app and a capacitor/vue.js mobile app.

Both apps are completly local and store your passwords localy like KeePass.
But the added feature is that you are able to sync your password between your phone and desktop without a backend.
The desktop app starts a node server and the phone scans the QR code and connects with it and exchanges new data. Both devices must be on the same network at the moment.
